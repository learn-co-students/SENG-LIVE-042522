# BigO
## SWBAT
- Solve algorithm questions
- Explain Space Time complexity 
- Identify Constant time
- Identify Linear time
- Identify Quadratic time

Given an array `[2, 9, 1, 3]` create a custom method/function to sort the array without using a built in sort method such as `.sort`. This can be done in JavaScript or Ruby 

Once done, do it again but using another algorithm.

### Time Complexity 
    The amount of time it takes the algo to run.

 - O(1) Constant 
 - O(n) Linear time
 - O(log n) [Logarithmic time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4ubFru2O80) 
 - O(n^2) Quadratic time 
 - O(n^n) Exponential time

 

 ### How to approach a DS and A question

 - Write the question down and confirm your assumptions  
 - Write out/explain steps for the solution before coding 
 - Code out solution 
 - Run test case examples 
 - Give Big - O
